This repository contains the HTML source code and additional resources for a
presentation that I, [Nikki R Luoma](https://nikki-luoma.github.io/), started to learn how to make a slide show using github.

You are welcome to use these slides as inspiration for your own presentation. If
you find this example useful, could I trouble you to star this repository and
then acknowledge it in your own presentation slides?

Are you interested in previewing the presentation without having to download the
code and resources from the GitHub site? Well, you can! Please view [Signing the Unspoken Contract](http://cdn.rawgit.com/nikki-luoma/fs102Spring2017-presentation01-Nikki-Luoma/master/datamining.html).
